# The What

The founding team is only a group of technical and non-technical persons that decided to dedicated a part of their time to spread knowledge about Arweave, help ecosystem's PSCs to reach a larger audience, simplify technical subject for non-technical readers and "arweavers".

# arweave.news Domain Name

We were lucky to acquire `arweave dot news` domain name for its self-powerful help in SEO optimization. Although, arweave.news organization is founded by the community, and for the community. The domain name doesn't have any meaning for a direct relation with <a href="https://arweave.org">arweave.org</a> team/foundation.

# ArweaveNews PSC

ArweaveNews, like the most of arweave-apps have its own DAO (PSC) to ensure the decentralization in the community, monetize the contributors, and create a business model.
